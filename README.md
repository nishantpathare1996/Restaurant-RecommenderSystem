# Restaurant-RecommenderSystem

## Project Overview
- Our aim was to use a yelp api to create an interactive website to provide recommendation features as well as restaurants based on the zipcodes to the user.
- Here, the user can enter a zip-code and select the categories of food and as a result he/she will get a list of top 10 restaurants and recommended restaurants. The user can
view reviews and write reviews. However, if the user wants to write a review he has to login first. We used mongodb atlas to store user reviews and have used it for creating a
recommendation system using python.
- We have also implemented visualizations for the users based on restaurants rating, price and review counts. We have used charts.js libraries for implementing data visualization
